            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Rules and Further Details</h2>

            <hr>
            <h2>CONTRACTS</h2>
            <p>Each player in the league has a current contract, or is a free agent. Players can be on contracts anywhere from 1 to 4 years.</p>
            <p>Like what is typical in the NFL, multi-year contracts increase in salary each season. If you sign a
                player to a 4 year contract with an AAV (Average Annual Value) of 26M, he’s going to cost ~23M
                the first year, and ~29M in the fourth.</p>
            <p>There is a chart in the RSO sheet titled “Auction Salary Splits” that you can plug an AAV into,
                and see how it splits between years. You should probably have an understanding of how this
                works before entering free agency.</p>
            <h3>100% of the first year of a contract is guaranteed. 50% of all future years are guaranteed.</h3>
            <p>For example, if I were to sign Carson Wentz to a 1 year contract worth 12M, and cut him before
                the season started, I would save 6M in cap, but owe him 6M in “dead cap”.
                Things are a little more complicated when cutting players with multiple years left.</p>
            <h3>If you cut a player with multiple years left in-season, any guaranteed salary counts against the
                current year’s cap. Any future year’s guarantees count against the subsequent season’s cap</h3>
                <p>For example, if you sign a player to a 4-year 50M contract, and cut him during his first season of
                    the contract, you will owe him the 100% guaranteed salary for the current season, and the 50%
                    guaranteed salary for all future years will be summed together, and will count against the
                    subsequent year’s cap. So, if the contact is 11M in the first year, 12M in the second, 13M in the
                    third, and 14M in the fourth, you would owe the entire 11M in the first year, and 19.5M (6+6.5+7)
                    would go against your cap in “dead money” the following season.</p>
                <p>If you cut a player in the offseason, any guaranteed salary counts against the upcoming year’s
                        cap. Any future year’s guarantees count against the following season’s cap.</p>
                <p>For example, If you were to cut that same player and contract (4-years 50M) in the offseason
                            after the first season of the contract, you would owe 6M in “dead money” for the upcoming 2nd
                            season, and 13.5M(6.5+7) in “dead money” the season following the upcoming season.</p>
                <p>Basically, if you cut a player, you’re always going to pay the current/upcoming year’s guarantees
                                in the current/upcoming year, and any remaining year’s dead cap will be summed together and
                                tacked on the season after the current/upcoming season</p>
                <h3>One-year league-minimum contracts, which are 0.5M, are not guaranteed.</h3>
                <p>You can cut these players without any dead money. This is something you’ll want to remember towards the end of
                    the free agency auction or when operating with a tight cap in-season</p>
                <p>Players earn “game checks” just like the NFL. Each game is 1/17th of their yearly salary. So, if
                    you have a player with a 17M salary, and cut him after week 4, you will have already paid him
                    4M in salary, and will be on the hook for any remaining guarantees.
                    </p>
                <p>So, when players are on minimum contracts, each game costs you 0.03M (0.5M/17GAMES).
                    There is no dead money when you cut these players, and the “cap charge” it displays when you
                    cut them is just the game checks you’ve already paid, not dead money.
                    </p>
                <p>You can see all player contracts on the RSO website, or on my RSO sheet. I would definitely
                    recommend the RSO sheet for any offseason planning. I do not update the rosters during the
                    season, so you’ll want to refer to the website in-season.</p>
                <hr>
            <h2>ROOKIE DRAFT</h2>
            <p>For now, all teams that do not make the playoffs have even odds for picks 1-6, and the draft
                order of the 6 playoff teams are determined by playoff standings.</p>
            <p>Rookie contracts are 4 years long, with 1st round picks having a 5th year team option. You
                    choose whether or not to trigger the 5th year option in the offseason following a player’s 3rd
                    season.</p>
            <h3>We do a few things outside the framework of RSO’s system. One of the things
                is make all 3rd, 4th, and 5th round contracts fully NON-guaranteed.
                </h3>
                <p>If you cut a player drafted in those rounds, still on his rookie contract, I will go in and delete any
                    dead cap. Because this is something I need to do independently of the system, be sure to text
                    Nick if you drop such a player.</p>
                <p>These players have two asterisks (**) next to their name on the RSO sheet.</p>
                <p>Another thing we do differently is reducing the contracts of both 4th and 5th round picks to 0.5M.
                    With how many veterans we have in the auction with 0.5M salaries, 4th and 5th rounders are
                    not worth rostering at RSO’s slotted salary.</p>
                <p>Rookie contracts are an integral part of building a competitive team. With top player contracts as
                    high as 35M+, having talented first and second round picks on contract anywhere from 3-12M is
                    a huge help. But, it’s hitting on 3rd-5th round picks that is really a gold mine. Paying players like
                    Chase Claypool or Darnell Mooney under 1% of the salary cap for four years makes things pretty
                    easy. Do your due diligence and make solid picks!</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>FREE AGENCY</h2>
                <p>In the offseason, with the exception of the franchise tag, there are no signings before the free
                    agency auction in August.</p>
                <p>The free agency auction uses RSO’s software to simulate a free agency period. Although their mock auctions are insanely
                    weak, you can still get an idea of what it’s like to bid on players. I would not make the mistake of
                    being unfamiliar with the software come free agency. A few teams botched year 1 pretty badly,
                    but if you take 10 minutes to understand it you should be completely fine.</p>
                <h3>You’ll have 10 seconds from the most recent bid to “up” the bid.</h3>
                <p>Once nobody ups the bid within
                    10 seconds, the team that made the “best” offer gets the player, and the software will
                    automatically adjust the cap space.</p>
                <p>When it’s your turn, you will nominate a player. This means you are putting in a base offer of
                        1-year 0.5M to this player. If nobody ups the bid, the player is yours for the minimum. The end of
                        the auction pretty much becomes a straight draft, with everybody filling out their roster with
                        minimum guys.</p>
                <h3>In the free agency auction, each team is allowed (1) four year contract, (2) three year contracts,
                    (3) two year contracts, and however many (1) year contracts are needed to fill out the roster.
                    </h3>
                <p>Players want the guarantees that come with multi-year contracts. Because of this they will
                    accept a lower AAV for more years.
                    There is always a 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, or 4-year deal they will accept over the current best
                    offer</p>
                <p>For example, if a player’s best offer was a 3-year deal for 54M, or 18M AAV, he would take a
                    1-year 27M deal, a 2-year 21.5M AAV deal, a 3-year 18.5M AAV deal, or a 4-year 15.5M AAV
                    over it.</p>
                <p>You can use hypothetical price points in the “Auction Price Points” chart of the left hand side of
                    the RSO sheet.
                    You do not have to use the multi year contracts if you do not want to.
                    You must fill out your 28 man roster, and RSO will hold 500K for each open slot.
                    </p>
                <p>So, if you have 10M in cap space, but need to sign 14 players, you only really have 3M that you
                    can spend on top of the 0.5M per player you’re going to need to fill out your roster. That is what I
                    call “Real Cap Space”, and is another reason I would use the RSO sheet over the website
                    during the offseason. The website is not great at displaying this stuff, but it’s all broken down on
                    the sheet.</p>
                <h3>You must be under the salary cap, with room to sign your rookies, by 3 days prior to the rookie
                    draft and free agent auction.</h3> 
                <p>If a team is not under the salary cap by 3 days prior to the draft, players will automatically be cut
                    from their roster. (This has not happened and should not happen if you’re paying attention)
                    </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>FRANCHISE TAG</h2>
                <p>Teams get one franchise tag per offseason. You have up until 3 days prior to the rookie draft
                    and free agency to tag a player.</p>
                <p>The franchise tag salary number is either 120% of the player’s previous year’s salary, or the
                    average of the top 5 salaries at that position, whichever is higher. The franchise tag number for
                    each position is listed on the left hand side of the RSO sheet.</p>
                <p>You can tag a player for up to 3 seasons, but on the 3rd tag the numbers are even higher. The
                        cap number is either 140% of the previous year’s salary, or the tag number of whichever
                        position has the highest top 5 average, whichever is higher.                        </p>
                <p>You cannot tag a player more than 3 times.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>CONTRACT EXTENSIONS</h2>
                <p>You get two contract extensions per season. They are available starting after week 4, and end
                    week 13 (14?) at the end of the regular season. Player’s “agents” offer the extensions, and you
                    take them or leave them.</p>
                <p>Only players on one year deals, or players on the last year of their deals can be extended.</p>
                <p>Extension salary offers will fluctuate throughout the season. Some owners have taken
                    advantage of a player’s sudden rise or down period. Don’t be afraid to take advantage of the
                    situation if you see an opportunity.</p>
                <h3>Players will never take a contract extension at an AAV lower than their current season’s salary.</h3>
                <p>For example, if you want to extend Tyreek Hill during the upcoming season, he will not offer a
                    deal with an AAV lower than 22.61M, his salary in 2021.</p>
                <p>There have been a few out of whack offers, but RSO says after enough seasons things should
                        balance out and extensions should be in line with fair market value. Overall, it seems a lot like
                        the NFL. You’re going to pay a slight premium for grabbing big name players in free agency.
                        They’ll come in a little cheaper on extensions. (See Wade’s Chubb and Diggs deals)</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>WAIVERS</h2>
                <p>If a player is waived, he is placed on waivers for one day. During this time, all of the other
                    league owners have the opportunity to place a waiver claim on that player and his contract.</p>
                <p>If the player is assigned to a new team via waivers, the acquiring team becomes responsible for
                    the remainder of the player’s contract, including guarantees, and the team that placed the player
                    on waivers receives no additional cap charge beyond games he has already played.</p>
                <p>The waiver order is determined based on league standings.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>INJURED RESERVE</h2>
                <p>You may place up to two players on IR at any time during the season.</p>
                <p>You cannot remove players from IR, but will get an open roster spot without having to cut the
                    player, and will receive 50% cap savings for the rest of the year.</p>
                <p>So, if you have a player with a salary of 17M, and place him on IR after week 4, you will have
                        paid 4M in game checks, and will have 6.5M in dead money as well as saving 6.5M in salary.</p>
                <p>If you have any questions about how anything works just text Nick. He has no problem taking the
                    time it takes to help people understand the platform. If you want to take a look at any of the
                    rookie stuff, there is a lot of stuff under the position specific tabs on the RSO sheet.</p>
